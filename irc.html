          <p>This is still a rough draft and may have rough, i.e., (corny|painful), humor. I'll turn this into a proper guide eventually but this should get the people I'm linking this to started.

            So you were probably directed here after someone kept bugging you to join the IRC channel or you've heard someone mention <i>IRC</i> and are curious what it is. At the moment, this guide is geared to the former because it is getting late and I have papers to write for class after this.

            <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat'>IRC</a> is a protocol for chat. With an IRC client, you log into a server where you can chat with other users on that server. Although you can message people privately, people typically chat in <i>channels.</i>

            Hey, here's the quickstart. If you've used IRC before, we're on Freenode and have channels at <code>#ulug</code> and <code>##uofu</code>, otherwise, you can use <a href='http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23ulug%2C%23%23uofu'>this</a> to jump in.
